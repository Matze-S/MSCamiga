                      SOME GENERAL COMPATIBILITY PROBLEM AREAS

            Generally fatal with any new OS:
              - Calling ROM code directly
              - Requiring all free RAM
              - Shaving stack size too close

            Often disastrous with new OS or hardware:
              - Depending on unsupported side effects
              - Bad flags/registers/condition code handling
              - Poking / peeking private system structures
              - Assuming current choices or configurations
              - Processor speed/instruction dependencies

            Strap:
              - romboot.library is gone
              - boot from other floppies (+5,-10,-20,-30)

            Exec:
              - Everything has moved, of course
              - Exec handles early expansion
              - Cold Capture done later
              - Exception/Interrupt vectors may move (VBR)
              - Size and types of MemHeaders may change
              - Survive reboot may break - new provided

            Expansion:
              - Two pass config, address slot reordering
              - ExpansionBase private - Use FindConfigDev()

            DOS:
              - Real library base with regular LVO vectors
              - Stack use all changed (variables, direction)
              - New packet and lock types
              - Process struct bigger, roll-your-own fails

            Workbench:
              - New sizes, depths, modes, fonts
              - Default Tool searches paths
              - New Look icons ( boxed )

            Intuition:
              - Private IBase variables moved/changed
              - Poking IBase Max Mouse variables now a no-op
              - Poking other private variables may be fatal
              - Larger screens, new modes, overscan support
              - GetScreenData() not enough to clone a screen
              - Scrollable screens (Left-Amiga/select stolen)
              - Rawkey|Vanillakey gives raw fkeys, help, etc.
              - Move SimpleRefresh win may not send refresh

            Layers:
              - Use NewLayerInfo() to create
                not FattenLayerInfo,ThinLayerInfo,InitLayers
              - Simple-refresh preserves all pixels it can

            Graphics:
              - Copper lists changed, illegal poking breaks
              - ColorMap bigger, must GetColorMap() to create
              - Blitter rtns decide ascend/descend on 1st plane
              - Some flying mode changes may break
              - GfxBase DisplayFlags and row/cols may != WB

            Fonts:
              - Some format changes (old format supported)
              - Private format of .font files has changed
              - Default font may be larger, proportional
              - Topaz is now sans-serif
              - Size created via bitmap scale if requested

            CLI / Shell:
              - Many more commands built-in (no longer in C:)
              - Limit of 20 gone, DOSBase CLI table changed
              - EOF char passed for Close Gadget in CLI
		This is -1L from CON: getchar, close gad esc seq from raw 
              - Uses simple-refresh character-mapped console

            Console:
              - CON: default is character-mapped console
              - Superbitmap console now has cursor (bug fixed)

            Audio.device:
              - Not initialized until used
              - This means lo-mem open failure possible

            Gameport.device:
              - Currently exclusive access

            Serial.device:
              - Clears io_Device on CloseDevice()

            Multi-Serial Boards:
              - May not support all params
              - So serial SetParams command may fail

            Timer.device:
              - Timer.device now trashes request as doc'd
              - IO_QUICK may defer and reply as doc'd

            Trackdisk:
              - Private trackdisk structures changed
              - Buffer freeable, lo-mem open fail possible

            CIA Timers:
              - CIAA Timer A is used by the system
              - CIAB Timer A and B currently available

            Hardware:
              - New RAM amounts and addresses
              - 32-bit addrs (trashed hi byte now matters)
              - New registers and bits
              - Battery-backed clock different

            New Look:
              - New default colors, new gadget images
              - Inner border line render
              - Window borders filled on active AND inactive
