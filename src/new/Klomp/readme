Here some Workbench 2.0 "Stuff"...

MapIcon:
 This will remap the white and black pens to conform with the new V2.0
standard.  This does not mean I agree that CBM should have changed the
arrangement of the perfectly fine order of the white and black pens.
But this should make things look better anyway...  If the icons are not
4 color icons, they will be after running MapIcon.  Also, only names
that have the ".info" extension will work with MapIcon.  To create a
script file, use...

 List >RAM:Map [DRIVE] all lformat "MapIcon >NIL: *"%s%s*""

This will map all the icons in a drive.  Type "failat 30" before running
the script.  Edit the file if you wish to remove icons that should not
be mapped (such as the preferences drawer).

Be sure NOT to use this file on copy protected disks as it may trash the
copy protection scheme (these disk must look ugly on the Workbench, that's
the way CBM wants it!).

ClkPointer:
 This little hack makes the Workbench's Wait-Clock's Hand spin.  It works
as of workbench.library version 36.2062.  It may not work with future
versions of the Workbench... That's what hacks are for!
