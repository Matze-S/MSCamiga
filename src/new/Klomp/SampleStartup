                           Sample Startup
                           ==============

This file describes a way for 68020/MMU, 68030, or autoconfig RAM
board owners to set up their harddisk system so that they can
choose to boot into either 2.0 or their normal 1.3 environment.

This sample startup uses "Kickit".  GVP accelerator + harddisk owners
must use MmuKick instead, with a special $F00000 Kickfile from CATS,
and special PALs from GVP.  Contact CATS Admin (215-431-9180) if you
need the special $F00000 kickfile; contact GVP about the PALs.

Users without harddisks should be able to modify the Boot Partition
startup to work off diskettes by referencing floppy volume names rather
than harddisk partitions and directories.


Part I describes a minimal boot floppy and floppy startup for 2090 owners.
This minimal boot floppy is just enough get you to the dh0: "boot"
partition and call its s/startup-sequence as if you had started there.
(SCSI owners - change the dh0:'s to dh2:'s)

Part II describes a minimal boot partition and startup to let you choose
between your normal 1.3 environment OR 2.0 when you reboot.

WARNING - Please BACK UP your hard disk and floppies, and read the
          KnownBugs files before testing any pre-release version of
          the operating system.


NOTE - Partition mounting under 2.0 requires that you provide a
       modified mountlist.  The sample startup references your old 1.3
       mountlist as devs:mountlist1.3, and your modified mountlist
       as devs:mountlist2.0.  In the modified mountlist, the FileSystem
       lines for your FFS partitions must be deleted or 
       commented out C-style like this:
             /*  FileSystem = l:FastFileSystem */
       AND the DosType for all FFS and old-FS entries must be correct:
             DosType = 0x444F5301        (for FFS)
         or  DosType = 0x444F5300        (for old-FS)

               Part I - Minimal Boot Floppy for 2090 Owners

A. Minimal Contents of Boot Floppy 
   ===============================

     NOTE: You should use 1.3 files/commands on your boot disk or
           partition, but future revisions of 2.0 may require 
           some 2.0 files when booting.  SetPatch, FastMemFirst, 
           FastFileSystem, and Disk-Validator are not found on
           (and not used by) Workbench 2.0.

; NOTE - Copy the 2.0 Workbench system-configuration here to get the
; proper 2.0 colors.  Whenever you change "classic" preferences within
; 2.0 (colors, printer, etc.), copy the 2.0 devs:system-configuration
; to this boot floppy.

                Part II - Minimal 1.3/2.0 Boot Partition

A. Minimal Contents of Boot Partition (Use 1.3 files where available)
   ==================================

     NOTE: You should use 1.3 files/commands to get to your 2.0 Workbench
           partition or directory, but future revisions of 2.0 may require 
           some 2.0 files when booting.  SetPatch, FastMemFirst, 
           FastFileSystem, and Disk-Validator are not found on
           (and not used by) Workbench 2.0.  Copy the 2.0 Workbench
	   system-configuration here to get the proper 2.0 colors.
           Whenever you change "classic" preferences within 2.0 (colors,
           printer, etc.), copy the 2.0 devs:system-configuration
           to this boot partition (or to your boot floppy if your hard
           disk is not an autoboot drive).

B. Startup-Sequence for Boot Partition
   ===================================

   NOTE! Please read through all of the comments in this startup.
         The comments point out the lines and areas you must
         change depending on your configuration.

         
; Sample harddisk startup-sequence to boot into either 1.3 or 2.0.
;
; NOTES:
;
; Non-autoboot (2090) users will also need the minimal boot disk
; described earlier, and can comment out the SetPatch and FastMemFirst
; lines in this script (They will be done by the boot disk startup).
;
; The system in this example is set up as follows:
;
;   Small initial normal-FS "boot" partition (SYS:, becoming INIT:)
;    containing KickIt and the specially linked Kick.[version].20 file.
;    If you do not have room in INIT: for the Kick file, you can
;    mount another partition to load it from.
;
;   The INIT: partition is either directly booted (autoboot) or quickly put
;    in control by minimal boot disk described above (non-autoboot).
;
;   This example system also contains:
;   1.3 FFS Workbench partition called WB3: (mounted for 1.3)
;   2.0 FFS Workbench partition called WB4: (mounted for 2.0)
;   FFS user work partition called FH0: (mounted for both 1.3 and 2.0)
;
; Alternately, you could just store each Workbench in its own directory,
; rather than in separate partitions.
;
; IMPORTANT:  During the post-soft-kick startup sequence, you should
;    not echo or output any information to the console until AFTER
;    the Workbench 2.0 startup completes its IPrefs initialization.
;    Console output will cause the initial shell window to open
;    and this should not be done until after IPrefs configuration
;    of the Workbench screen.
