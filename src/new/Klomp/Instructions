Dear Amiga 2.0 Developer,


     Enclosed is the developer Kickfile disk for the 2.01 release.  It
contains kickfile kick.143.20 (Kickstart version 36.143 for the A2000).
This release is an update to kickstart only and is designed to be used
with the 2.0 Workbench and Extras disks.

     The above disks and the KickIt command allow most developers to install
2.0 on Amigas other than the A3000 and soft-kick into 2.0 using the KickIt
command.  Developers who have purchased A3000's will receive the A3000
release software installation disks under separate cover.



   Instructions for installing 2.0 follow.



				Instructions
                       		============

*****	This Release consists of the following software:
  	  - Kickfile disk containing 512K 2.01 Kick.[version].20 file
	  - Workbench 2.0
	  - Extras 2.0


*****	Where to find some important commands and files:

	- BugReport	   In ReportForms file on Kickfile disk
	- CompatReport     In ReportForms file on KickFile disk
	- CPU		   Workbench/c directory (cpu.doc in Kickfile/tools)
	- KickIt	   Tools directory of Kickfile disk
	- Kick.[vers].20   In the root of the Kickfile disk
	- SampleStartup    Kickfile disk

*****	How to boot 2.0

        In order to use the new 2.0 Workbench, you must "soft-kick"
the 2.0 operating system "kick.[version].20" using the new "Kickit"
command (both found on the Kickfile disk).  Owners of GVP accelerator
plus harddisk cards will need to get special PALs from GVP, and get
a special $F00000 kickfile from CATS for use with the mmu soft-kick
program (Mmukick).  If you need the special MMUKICK disk, call
CATS Administration at 215-431-9180 to have it mailed to you.

    NOTE - You should always back up your harddisk and work disks
           before installing new operating system software.

***** Easy Ways To Try 2.0

The simplest setup for trying 2.0 is ANY MODEL Amiga whose first or
only autoconfig expansion card is RAM.

Some simple setups include an A2000 or A1000 with a 2-meg RAM expansion.

The new KickIt command allows you to "soft-kick" a special 2.0
operating system file so that you can use the 2.0 Workbench disk.

The easy no-installation way to boot 2.0 on a simple setup is as follows:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Boot normally with 1.3 and open a shell or CLI

2. Insert the Kickfile disk in df0: and type:
       df0:Tools/kickit df0:kick.38n.20
       (kickit will read the kick.38n.20 file and reboot your machine)

3. When the 2.0 Workbench disk prompt appears, insert the 2.0 Workbench disk.

    NOTE - If you have an autoboot harddisk, pull the Kickfile disk
      during the KickIt reboot, and insert the 2.0 Workbench disk to
      boot the 2.0 Workbench.  See the SampleStartup file on the Kickfile 
      disk for instructions on installing 2.0 so that you can easily
      boot into your choice of 1.3 or 2.0 from your harddisk.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

You don't need an MMU, or coprocessor, or new ROMs, or ECS.

You just need a first configured autoconfig RAM device 1 meg or larger.
(might work with a 1/2 meg autoconfig card - not tested).

In addition to "plain" RAM expansions, the A2620 and A2630 coprocessor
carsd may be used because they contain RAM which is configured first.
Third party coprocessor+RAM cards should also work.
Some harddisk+RAM or coprocessor+harddisk+RAM cards may work, but
only if they configure their RAM first (the A590 and A2091 do not, but
you could use a 2091 if you have a separate RAM card in the right slot).
GVP owners should see the earlier notes about GVP.

***** The following items are all OPTIONAL when using 2.0:

68020, 68030, MMU, Enhanced Chip Set, multisync monitor, additional hardware

If you have a 2620 or 2630, the soft-kicked 2.0 will be in 32-bit RAM (fast!).
If you have a harddrive, you can set your system up so that you can boot
boot into 1.3 OR 2.0 off your harddrive (see SampleStartup on Kickfile disk).
If you have the Enhanced Chip Set you will be able to try the new video
modes (most require a multisync monitor).





***** Special instructions for PAL machines and Multisync monitors

    Addmonitor can be used in your startup-sequence to add the PAL
    A2024, and multisync monitors.  Or you can drag the monitor icons
    into the Workbench startup drawer.  (However, you may not be able
    to boot in the proper mode in that case.)

    addmonitor NUM=2 NAME=pal.monitor
    addmonitor NUM=3 NAME=multisync.monitor
    addmonitor NUM=4 NAME=A2024.monitor

    The initial setting is for a 640x200 NTSC screen.  To try another
    size, use the WBSCREEN preferences editor (after either adding
    the ADDMONITOR calls to the Startup-Sequence or by dragging the icons
    to the WBStartup drawer)
